![](qe-logo-large.png)


## Abstract

The recent surge in artificial intelligence research and investment has driven
emergence of groundbreaking scientific computing environments in recent years,
each equipped with advanced features like automatic differentiation, parallel
computing capabilities, and just-in-time compilation. This workshop will deliver
a concise survey of these evolving AI-driven computational tools and explore
their potential applications within economic research and analysis,
demonstrating how the accelerated pace of AI development is creating new
opportunities for computational economics.
